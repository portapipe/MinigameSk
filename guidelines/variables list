#Main Idea
mgg = minigame global
mgl = minigame list
mgu = minigame user
mgo = minigame options
mgc = minigame current

#Main Vars
mgg::vars
mgl::%arenasName%
mgu.%player%::vars
mgo.%arenaName%::vars
mgc.%arenaName%::vars

I know, 2 vars array for the same arena… I think is will be more easy to manage and read, plus the options are all apart from the main arena default settings like the arena name and other non-options vars.



#Global Vars

mgg::

lobby #a main global lobby. You can set the single arena lobby too
quit  #a main global quit position. You can set the single quit too


#Arena List Var

mgl::%nameOfTheArena% #Useful for name check on creation and loops for GUI

setting {mvl::arenatest} to "Public Arena Name" #to have a readable name 

#User Vars

mgu.%player%::

points
arena
spectator (true or false, need to think about spectator mode)

It should be cool to have an option to activate some "points" vars for dedicated mg's server


#Options Vars (a lot and need to think of what we really need)

mgo.%arenaName%::

minPlayers
maxPlayers
maxScore
lateJoin (true or false) #permit to join on a started game
spawn
team (true or false)
t1spawn (team 1 spawn)
t2spawn (team 2 spawn)
t3spawn (team 3 spawn)
t4spawn (team 4 spawn)
quit (quit position)
lobby (lobby position)
scoreType ([?] this one should not be necessary because every external game type has his own score type method like tdm has kills, ctf has the captured flags…)
gameType (we'll took this from external files, one for game type)

#need to think about this possibility:
blockPlace
blockBrake
gamemode
checkpoint
reset
startTime
reward

#and this one are far from now but should be considerate:
defaultWinner
blockDrop
itemPickup
itemDrop
restoreBlocks
unlimitedAmmo

#Current Vars (that can be deleted at the end of the arena and clean all in once)

mgc.%arenaName%::

players #the actual number of players into that arena
points #the actual points of the game
started #useful to close the join if there's no lateJoin
ended #useful to deny damage and delay the quit of the arena and say some messages


#depending of what we'll add…
regenerationRunning #if we'll make a regeneration of the arena
